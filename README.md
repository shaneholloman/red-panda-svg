# Red Panda SVG

"Red Panda" was the secret codename of an AI image generation model that was [topping the charts in October 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1gdiacx/new_model_on_top_of_artificial_analysis_image/) before its official release.

The real model's name is **recraft-v3**, and it's developed by [Recraft](https://recraft.ai/).

You can run it on Replicate here using your browser or an HTTP API:

- https://replicate.com/recraft-ai/recraft-v3-svg
- https://replicate.com/recraft-ai/recraft-v3

The most exciting thing (to me) about this model is that it can generate SVG images.

This demo is just a bit of fun to take a recraft-generated SVG and use JS and CSS to animate it:
